## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Query Type Classification

- **SELECT**: "Find all X", "List Y", "Show me Z"
- **COUNT**: "How many X", "Count Y", "Number of Z"
- **ASK**: "Is X a Y?", "Does Z have W?"
- **DESCRIBE**: "Describe X", "Tell me about Y"
- **CONSTRUCT**: "Build graph", "Create graph"

### 2. Entity Recognition and Resolution

- Extracts entities from natural language
- Types: class, property, literal, person, organization, location, gene, protein, disease, drug, publication, dataset
- Resolves entities using:
  - Ontology information (OWL classes and properties)
  - Schema information (discovered URIs)
  - Fuzzy matching for partial matches
- Confidence scoring for each entity
- Alternative interpretation tracking

### 3. Filter Detection and Parsing

Supports multiple filter operators:
- **Equality**: "where X is Y", "X equals Y", "X named Y"
- **Comparison**: "greater than", "less than", "at least", "at most"
- **Contains**: "containing X", "including Y"
- **Regex**: "matches pattern", "like X"

Extracts:
- Variable to filter
- Operator type
- Filter value
- Datatype and language tags
- Negation support

### 4. Aggregation Detection

Supports all SPARQL aggregation functions:
- **COUNT**: "how many", "count", "number of"
- **SUM**: "sum", "total", "add up"
- **AVG**: "average", "mean"
- **MIN**: "minimum", "smallest", "lowest"
- **MAX**: "maximum", "largest", "highest"
- **GROUP_CONCAT**: "concatenate", "combine"
- **SAMPLE**: "sample", "example"

Features:
- GROUP BY detection
- DISTINCT support
- Result variable naming
- Multiple aggregations per query

### 5. Order and Limit Extraction

**Ordering:**
- Explicit: "order by X", "sort by Y"
- Implicit: "top 10", "highest", "best"
- Direction: ASC (ascending) or DESC (descending)

**Limit/Offset:**
- "top N", "first N", "limit N"
- "skip N", "offset N"

### 6. Advanced Features

**Optional Patterns:**
- Detects optional/nullable patterns
- Keywords: "optional", "if available", "if exists", "may have"

**Property Paths:**
- Transitive relationships: "all ancestors", "all descendants"
- Path traversal: "through X", "via Y"

**Text Search:**
- Search term extraction
- Keywords: "search for", "containing", "related to", "matching"
- Quoted string support

**Distinct Detection:**
- Keywords: "distinct", "unique", "different"

### 7. Query Pattern Classification

Classifies queries into 11 common SPARQL patterns:
1. **COUNT_SIMPLE**: Basic counting
2. **COUNT_GROUP_BY**: Counting with grouping
3. **TOP_N_AGGREGATION**: Top N with ordering
4. **FULL_TEXT_SEARCH**: Text search queries
5. **COMPLEX_JOIN**: Multi-entity joins
6. **SIMPLE_FILTER**: Basic filtering
7. **PROPERTY_PATH**: Property path traversal
8. **BASIC_LIST**: Simple listing
9. **ASK_VERIFICATION**: Yes/no questions
10. **DESCRIBE_ENTITY**: Entity descriptions
11. **GENERIC_SELECT**: Generic queries

### 8. Query Structure Suggestion

Generates suggested SPARQL structure:
- SELECT variables
- WHERE patterns
- FILTER clauses
- Aggregations
- Modifiers (ORDER BY, LIMIT, DISTINCT, GROUP BY)

### 9. Confidence Scoring

Calculates confidence based on:
- Entity resolution success (0-100% resolved)
- Query pattern clarity
- Ambiguity presence
- Filter specificity

Score ranges:
- **High (>0.9)**: Clear entities, well-defined patterns
- **Medium (0.7-0.9)**: Some ambiguity, partial resolution
- **Low (<0.7)**: Significant ambiguity or missing information

### 10. Ambiguity Detection

Detects and reports:
- **Entity ambiguity**: Multiple possible interpretations
- **Unresolved entities**: No URI mapping found
- **Ambiguous filters**: Unclear filter targets
- **Vague patterns**: Unclear intent

## Data Structures

### ParsedIntent
Complete parsed intent structure:
```python
@dataclass
class ParsedIntent:
    original_query: str
    query_type: QueryType
    entities: List[Entity]
    filters: List[Filter]
    aggregations: List[Aggregation]
    order_by: List[OrderClause]
    limit: Optional[int]
    offset: Optional[int]
    distinct: bool
    optional_patterns: List[str]
    property_paths: List[str]
    text_search: List[str]
    confidence: float
    ambiguities: List[Dict[str, Any]]
    metadata: Dict[str, Any]
```

### Entity
```python
@dataclass
class Entity:
    text: str
    type: str
    uri: Optional[str]
    confidence: float
    alternatives: List[str]
    context: Dict[str, Any]
```

### Filter
```python
@dataclass
class Filter:
    variable: str
    operator: FilterOperator
    value: Any
    datatype: Optional[str]
    language: Optional[str]
    negated: bool
```

### Aggregation
```python
@dataclass
class Aggregation:
    type: AggregationType
    variable: str
    result_variable: str
    distinct: bool
    group_by: List[str]
```

## Pattern Mappings (As Required)

### 1. "Find all X where Y" → SELECT with filters
```python
query = "Find all proteins where organism is human"
intent = parse_query(query)
# → QueryType.SELECT
# → entities: [Entity(text='proteins', type='protein'), ...]
# → filters: [Filter(variable='organism', operator=EQUALS, value='human')]
```

### 2. "How many X" → COUNT aggregation
```python
query = "How many proteins are there?"
intent = parse_query(query)
# → QueryType.COUNT
# → aggregations: [Aggregation(type=COUNT, variable='*', result_variable='count')]
```

### 3. "Show relationships between X and Y" → Complex joins
```python
query = "Show relationships between genes and diseases"
intent = parse_query(query)
# → QueryType.SELECT
# → entities: [Entity(text='genes', type='gene'), Entity(text='diseases', type='disease')]
# → pattern: "COMPLEX_JOIN"
```

### 4. "Top 10 X by Y" → ORDER BY + LIMIT
```python
query = "Top 10 genes by expression"
intent = parse_query(query)
# → QueryType.SELECT
# → order_by: [OrderClause(variable='expression', direction=DESC)]
# → limit: 10
# → pattern: "TOP_N_AGGREGATION"
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
from sparql_agent.query import IntentParser, parse_query, classify_query

# Quick parsing
intent = parse_query("Find all proteins from human")
print(f"Type: {intent.query_type.value}")
print(f"Entities: {len(intent.entities)}")

# Quick classification
pattern = classify_query("Count proteins per organism")
print(f"Pattern: {pattern}")
```

### With Ontology
```python
from sparql_agent.query import IntentParser
from sparql_agent.core.types import OntologyInfo

parser = IntentParser(ontology_info=ontology)
intent = parser.parse("Find all proteins")
# Entities will be resolved to ontology URIs
```

### With Schema
```python
from sparql_agent.query import IntentParser
from sparql_agent.core.types import SchemaInfo

parser = IntentParser(schema_info=schema)
intent = parser.parse("Find all proteins")
# Entities will be resolved to schema URIs
```

### Query Structure Suggestion
```python
parser = IntentParser()
intent = parser.parse("Count proteins per organism")
structure = parser.suggest_query_structure(intent)

print(structure['pattern'])  # "COUNT_GROUP_BY"
print(structure['select_variables'])  # ['(COUNT(?protein) AS ?count)', '?organism']
```

```

## Integration Points

### With Prompt Engine
```python
from sparql_agent.query import IntentParser, PromptEngine

parser = IntentParser()
intent = parser.parse(query)

prompt_engine = PromptEngine()
scenario = prompt_engine.detect_scenario(intent.original_query)
```

### With Query Generator
```python
from sparql_agent.query import IntentParser

parser = IntentParser(schema_info=schema, ontology_info=ontology)
intent = parser.parse(query)
structure = parser.suggest_query_structure(intent)

# Use structure to generate SPARQL
# ... (integrate with generator)
```

## Performance Characteristics

- **Pattern matching**: O(n) with compiled regex
- **Entity resolution**: O(m) where m = ontology/schema size
- **Fuzzy matching**: O(k) where k = number of candidates
- **Overall parsing**: O(n + m) for typical queries

Optimizations:
- Compiled regex patterns
- Early termination on high-confidence matches
- Caching opportunities for entity resolution
